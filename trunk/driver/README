1)	Linux Kernel 2.6.11(?) or later
	http://www.kernel.org/

2) 	IEEE80211 subsystem
	http://ieee80211.sourceforge.net/
	NOTE: on some systems you may need to:
		ln -s /usr/include/net/ieee80211.h \
		/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/net/ieee80211.h; \
		ln -s /usr/include/net/ieee80211_crypt.h \
		/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/net/ieee80211_crypt.h
	      in order to build the driver, after installing the ieee80211 modules.

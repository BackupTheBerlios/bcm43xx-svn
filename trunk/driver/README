			BCM43XX Linux Driver Project
			============================

About this software
-------------------

The goal of this project is to develop a linux driver for Broadcom
BCM43xx chips, based on the specification at 
http://bcm-specs.sipsolutions.net/

The project page is http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/


Requirements
------------

1)	Linux Kernel 2.6.14 or later
	http://www.kernel.org/

	Please configure your kernel with:
	a) CONFIG_IEEE80211 (required):
		-> Networking
		  -> Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack

	b) CONFIG_DEBUG_FS (optional):
		-> Kernel hacking
		  -> Debug Filesystem

2)	Firmware Files

	Please try fwcutter. Fwcutter can extract the firmware from various 
	binary driver files. It supports driver files from Windows, MacOS and 
	Linux. You can get fwcutter from http://bcm43xx.berlios.de/.
	Also, fwcutter comes with a README file for further instructions.

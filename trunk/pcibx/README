About this software
-------------------

This program can be used to control the Catalyst PCIBX32-X and
PCIBX64-X PCI Extender card through the parallel port interface.


Usage
-----

See  pcibx --help  for detailed usage description.
And read the manual of your PCI Extender. ;)


Bug / Issues
------------

The Parallel Port is currently accessed through userspace outb()
and inb() calls. These functions are not available on all
architectures. When porting this application to something else
than X86, a kernel level driver might be required.
But that's a very minor issue, as just the lowlevel functions in
pcibx_device.c have to be replaced.
